            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Hand-coding was the norm</h3>
        <pre>
            
            
            In the 1990s, many websites were built by typing HTML and design 
            elements directly by hand. The essay highlights this as part of the 
            “handmade web” tradition — a practice rooted in the earliest years 
            of the World Wide Web, long before visual editors and automated tools 
            became widespread.


            Building a website meant manually writing HTML in a text editor. 
            There were no streamlined drag-and-drop builders, social media templates, or 
            algorithm-driven feeds. This meant creators had direct control over structure, 
            layout, links, images, and text. The essay emphasizes that this kind of coding 
            was not just technical labor — it was creative labor.
            

            Because sites were written line by line, they often contained visible quirks: 
            broken links, unusual layouts, flashing GIFs, tiled backgrounds, or experimental typography. 
            These imperfections were not failures; they were signs of authorship. The “handmade” quality 
            reflected the early web material conditions — slow dial-up connections, limited tools, and a 
            small but curious community of makers.
    
           
            The 1990s web movement therefore treated coding as craft, much like zine-making or 
            collage. Writing HTML was part of the artistic process.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Personal expression and creativity were central</h3>
        <pre>


            Web creators in the 1990s often made sites that were highly personal, 
            artistic, or experimental, rather than commercial or corporate. 


            In the 1990s, many people created homepages hosted on platforms like 
            GeoCities or university servers. These pages might include diaries, 
            fan art, poetry, photography, or hyperlinked essays.
            

            Rather than being optimized for profit or visibility, these sites were 
            built for expression and exploration. The web functioned as a creative 
            playground. The mention of early web artwork from 1995 situates this practice 
            within a broader artistic movement, where artists used HTML itself as a medium.
            

            This period is often described as experimental because conventions were still forming. 
            There were no standard design rules yet. Navigation could be nonlinear, 
            fragmented, or playful. The web felt open-ended, unfinished, and exploratory 
            qualities the essay values and seeks to preserve.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Early web practices emphasized openness and direct access</h3>
        <pre>


            The 1990s web movement fostered a culture where individuals 
            could publish their own content freely and explore unconventional 
            aesthetics or ideas. This aligns with the “handmade web” argument 
            in the essay: that early web design was more about self-expression 
            and craft than about platforms, optimization, or monetization.

            
            One defining feature of the 1990s web movement was that individuals 
            could publish independently. You did not need a corporate platform 
            to host your ideas; you could upload files to a server and make them 
            publicly accessible. This autonomy fostered a decentralized internet 
            culture.
            

            The essay frames this early web as resistant to todays platform-dominated 
            ecosystem. In the 1990s, the web was less about surveillance, data extraction, 
            branding, or algorithmic visibility. Instead, it was structured around hyperlinks 
            a network of connections made intentionally by authors.
            
            
            This model encouraged slow browsing and discovery. Users followed links 
            from one handmade site to another, creating communities through shared 
            interests rather than through centralized feeds. The 1990s web movement 
            thus represents a moment of relative freedom, where publishing was accessible 
            and control remained largely in the hands of individual creators.
